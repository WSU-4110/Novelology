# Project Installation Instructions

This guide will walk you through setting up the project environment on Visual Studio Code (VSCode) using ReactJS and Node.js.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (which includes npm)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSCode)

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WSU-4110/Novelology.git
```

## Step 2: Open the Project in VSCode

Navigate to the cloned project directory:

```bash
cd your-project-repository
```

Open the project in VSCode:

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

In the VSCode terminal, install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary packages listed in the `package.json` file.

## Step 4: Start the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start the React application on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You can view your application in your web browser.

## Additional Notes

- If you encounter any issues with `npm install`, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and the `package-lock.json` file, then run `npm install` again.
